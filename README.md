## Description

This code implements a basic Hangman game where a player needs to guess a word one letter at a time. If the player guesses all the letters correctly before running out of lives, they win. Otherwise, they lose.

## How to Play

1. The game selects a random word for you to guess.
2. You have a limited number of lives (6 by default).
3. Guess a letter by entering it when prompted.
4. If the letter is in the word, it will be revealed in its correct position(s).
5. If the letter is not in the word, you will lose a life.
6. Continue guessing letters until you either complete the word or run out of lives.

## Installation
